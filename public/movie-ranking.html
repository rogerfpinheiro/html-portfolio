<h1>The Best movies according Rog√©rio Pinheiro</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>The Driver drives for hire. He has no other name, and no other life. When we first see him, he's the wheelman for a getaway car, who runs from police pursuit not only by using sheer speed and muscle, but by coolly exploiting the street terrain and outsmarting his pursuers.
<br>By day, he is a stunt driver for action movies. The two jobs represent no conflict for him: He drives.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>"Spirited Away" is surely one of the finest of all animated films, and it has its foundation in the traditional bedrock of animation, which is frame-by-frame drawing.</p>
<h3>Seven 7</h3>
<p>It is almost always raining in the city. Somerset, the veteran detective, wears a hat and raincoat. Mills, the kid who has just been transferred into the district, walks bare-headed in the rain as if he'll be young forever.</p>
